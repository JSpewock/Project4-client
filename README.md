# Project4-client
*Coded by Jeremy Spewock*

Project 4... We made it... I made this project using Flask, React, Postgres, and Python. 

For this project I was given quite the task. Two weeks to build this project along side my portfolio but, the twist was, I could use any stack I wanted. The only rule (outside of a minimum number of commits) was to implement something new. It could be a new stack, a new package, a new library, just challenge yourself with something you've never used before. So, for some reason, I chose to make things even harder than necessary for myself. First, I chose to use a language I wasn't very familiar with, python. I had only been introduced to python 1 week before final projects came around. I onl really had time to learn the basics so I thought python and flask in my final project would be a good challenge and a good way to better my understanding of it. So, that's where it started.

Next, I had to choose something I had never used before. For this, I chose to use JWT (Json Web Tokens) for user authentication. JWT was something I knew of but had never used so I thought it would be a good contender for my new technology. It didn't stop there though, I was also very interested in react router and learning what it was capable of so, I decided to use that as well. The idea for my app wasn't that outragious, I wanted to make a discussion board that was centered around people ranting. It wasn't exactly the most positive approach, but having just recently learned about python and SQL databases, I though it would be really cool to try and use the relational data to relate data to users and comments to their posts. So, I started building and, 2 weeks later, it became what it is now.

**Unsolved Problems**
There is really only one issue that I didn't have time to fix and that is the jwts expire every hour but when your jwt expires, the content in the header does not accurately reflect that you are no longer signed in. This is something that doesn't hinder the app all that much, but it's a notable flaw.
